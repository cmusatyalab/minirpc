WHAT IS MINIRPC?
----------------

miniRPC is a remote procedure call library which works on top of TCP.
It has the following design goals:

- Simple on-the-wire protocol
- Scalability to large numbers of connections
- Automatic stub generation
- No use of a portmapper: clients connect directly to the well-known port for
  a service
- Simple usage model for synchronous RPCs
- Straightforward support for asynchronous RPCs, including out-of-order
  replies, at both client and server
- Application-defined event loop
- Support for bidirectional communication: both the client and the server can
  initiate RPCs
- Support for event notifications, which do not require a reply
- Support for multi-threaded operation with an application-defined threading
  model
- Support for multiple RPC protocols and protocol roles in a single process
- Support for TLS encryption (currently unimplemented)

INSTALLING MINIRPC
------------------

You will need the following utility programs:

- rpcgen (to build stub code)
- doxygen (to build documentation)
- pdflatex (to build PDF documentation)

To install the library and minirpcgen:

./configure
make
make check		(optional)
make install

To build and install HTML documentation:
